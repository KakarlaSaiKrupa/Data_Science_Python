# Python Basic to End

Python is a programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level too.

- Python executes line by line code.
- If it satisfies by the rule then only it ececutes the line of code.

## Python Data_Types

- Integer
- Float
- String
- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary

#### Examples

Integer : 45

Float : 55.56

String : 'Python','123','python123'

List : [10,20,30,40,50]

Tuple : (10,20,30,40,50)

Sets : {10,20,30,40,50}

Dictionary : {Key_value}->{'apple':100}

## Python Variable

The variable is stored in temporary memory called RAM.

Ex: a = 90

When we call 'a' ,it gives 98 as output.

- int - uses 4 bytes of memory 
- float - uses 4 bytes of memory 
- string - uses 1 byte of memory

## Rules to create a variable
 
There are 4 different rules to create a variable

- Variable should not start with a number if needed
  we want to start with the underscore(_).

  EX:  _9a=100
- Variable should be single word or single character but not       multiple words if needed we have to use underscore(_).

  Ex: Sai_Ram = 100
- Python variables are completely case sensitive.

  Ex: 

      name ='sai'
      print(NAME) #here call name because it is case sensitive
      output: error

- Punctuations are not used as a variable 

  Ex: $=100 
      print($) 
      output: Invalid 

## Relation between print and variable :
- Using , (comma) inside the print we can add one data type with other data type and comma gives one tab space.
- Using + we can add string data type along with given variables but we need to make sure that given variables are also string and the + operator won't give any tab space.
- Using Identifiers like %d -> int
                         %f -> float
                         %s -> str
- Using { } and f function.
  if f see anything in the flower braces, it prints which is in {}flower braces

## Operators
- Addition -> +
- Substraction -> -
- Multiplication -> *
- Division -> /
- FLoor Division->//
- Mod function-> %
- Power->** 
- Built_in_Function->pow()
- Greaterthan-> >
- Lessthan-> <
- Greaterthan or equal to-> >=
- Lessthan or equal to-> <=
- Equal to-> =
- Double equal to->==
- Not equal to->!=
- and 
- or

# Python String Concept:
String is represented in the quotes - ' '

Ex: a = 'pyton'
